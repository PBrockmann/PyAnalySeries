PyAnalySeries Reimagined: A Legacy Tool Reborn

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/855161808.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15225020)

**PyAnalySeries** is a Python application built on **matplotlib**, with a **PyQt-based graphical interface**, making it easily portable across platforms including **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

It is designed as a modern continuation of the **AnalySeries (Legacy)** tool, aiming to reproduce and extend its core functionalities within a more robust and portable Python environment.

Special attention has been given to **ergonomics**, emphasizing **simplicity** and **clarity**, while offering intuitive interactivity such as **zooming**, **panning**, and **scrolling**, with **linked or independent axes**.

The core design follows a **"Define then Apply"** workflow for data processing operations such as **filtering**, **sampling**, and **interpolation**.

Data is imported from and stored in an **open format**, using a **spreadsheet-format file** with **multiple worksheets** for organization. It is also possible to import series or pointers directly from the **clipboard**, following a simple **copy (Ctrl+C)** operation from an external spreadsheet or text editor.

The application leverages **robust, well-tested modules** for interpolation, notably **SciPy**, and features an **interactive interface** for defining **interpolation pointers** (formerly known as *Linage* and *Splinage*), allowing for **precise placement and manipulation**â€”either directly on data points or independently.

Based on:
 * numpy
 * pandas
 * matplotlib
 * scipy
 * shapely
 * openpyxl
 * PyQt
